# Notes
Except for the Lazy Load library, no javascript library was used in the project.

While writing the project, gulp.js is used to create automation.

Boostrap's only grid is templated and called.

There are modules in the simple style guide pages.

Since I wrote vanilla.js, I did not use any template engine.
## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Usage

```
start project: gulp watch 

build project: gulp build

only compiler style: gulp style
